# Smoke test

Manual checks to run after a deploy or a significant merge. Each PR that adds a feature adds its steps here.

## Skeleton

1. `docker compose up -d` starts PostgreSQL, Redis and Mailpit; `docker compose ps` shows all three running.
2. `php artisan migrate --seed` completes without errors.
3. `php artisan serve` starts, and the home page loads showing "Somaplus" and its tagline, with no broken styles.
4. A template asset loads, for example `/assets/css/somaplus.css` returns 200.
5. `vendor/bin/pest`, `vendor/bin/pint --test`, `vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --level=5`, `composer audit` and `npm run build` all pass.
6. The template is unchanged. Clone `https://github.com/Swai-D/merge-temp`, check out `b716aa1`, then from the repository root both `diff -r <clone>/somaplus/assets public/assets` and `diff -r <clone>/somaplus resources/template-original -x assets` print nothing.

## Tenancy and plans

Create two schools and a plan from `php artisan tinker`:

```php
$plan = App\Models\SubscriptionPlan::where('key', 'basic')->first();
App\Models\Tenant::create(['name' => 'Acme', 'slug' => 'acme', 'subscription_plan_id' => $plan->id]);
App\Models\Tenant::create(['name' => 'Beta', 'slug' => 'beta', 'subscription_plan_id' => $plan->id]);
```

1. `php artisan migrate --seed` creates three plans: basic, medium and enterprise (`SubscriptionPlan::count()` is 3). Running the seeder again does not duplicate them.
2. `http://localhost:8000` (central domain) shows the home page. `http://acme.localhost:8000` shows it too. `http://nobody.localhost:8000` answers 404.
3. Sending `X-Tenant: acme` to the central domain does not change the tenant.
4. Set `subscription_status` of Acme to `read_only`: pages still load.
